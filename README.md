# Book Library Management System

This project is a **Book Library Management System** built using **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Redis**. It consists of three main services:

1. **Admin API**: For managing books and users.
2. **Frontend API**: For user interactions like borrowing books.
3. **Auth API**: For authentication and authorization.

The system uses **PostgreSQL** as the primary database and **Redis** for caching and message brokering. Authentication in **Frontend API** and **Admin API** is handled by **Auth Service**.

## Project Overview

The **Book Library Management System** is designed to handle:

- **Book Management**: Add, remove, and list books.
- **User Management**: Enroll users and manage their profiles.
- **Borrowing System**: Allow users to borrow and return books.
- **Authentication**: Secure access using JWT tokens.

The system is containerized using **Docker** and orchestrated with **Docker Compose**.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed.
- **Python 3.10** or higher (for local development).

### Starting the Services

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/drlsv91/book-library.git
   cd book-library
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of each service with the required environment variables. Refer to the individual service `README.md` files for details.

3. Start the services using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. The services will be available at:
   - **Admin API**: `http://localhost:9001`
   - **Frontend API**: `http://localhost:9002`
   - **Auth API**: `http://localhost:9003`
   - **PostgreSQL Database**: `localhost:5432`
   - **Redis**: `localhost:6379`
